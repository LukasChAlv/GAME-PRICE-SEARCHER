# Game Price Checker ðŸŽ®ðŸ’¸

This is my first attempt at working with APIs.
It's a small Python project that checks for the best prices on video games using the CheapShark API. Just enter a game's name, and it will show all the available deals from different online stores. You can also choose to save the offers in a CSV file.

## Features

- Search for the best deals by game title
- See prices and links to each store
- Option to save all offers in a CSV file
- Automatically shows the game name on output and in the CSV
